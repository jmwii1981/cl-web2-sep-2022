# Syntax and Operators

**Note to self** â€“ Review all of the material in this section in the YDKJS series by Kyle Simpson. Keep in mind that the series focuses on ES 6 in some regards and note the differences.

## Using for/in Loops

## Using for/of Loops

## Break / Continue Statements

## Labeled Statements ('A No-No')

## Switch Statements

## Using Math and Comparison Operators
 - typical math operators are ...
  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`
  - `**`
  - `%`

### Operators
 - operand operator operand
 - operands are what's being "operated" on by the operator

### Plus Caveats (Addition/Concatination)
 - `"strings" + "strings"` is concatination and combines the two strings together
 - `10 + 10` or _integer_ `+` _integer_ is addition

### Assignment Operators
- `price = 5` // var price is set to equal 5
 - `price += 5` // price = price + 5 (or price = 5 + 5); evaluates to 10
 - `price *= 5` // price = price * 5 (or price = 5 * 5); evaluates to 25
 - `price /= 5` // price = price / 5 (or price = 5 / 5); evaluates to 1
 - `price **= 5` // price = price ** 5 (or price = 5^5 [5 to the power of 5]); evaluates to 3125
 - `price %= 5` // price = price / 5 to get the remainder of 1 (this can be used to evaluate whether an integer is odd or even)

### Comparison Operators (In order of precedence)
 - `<` // Less than
 - `<=` // Less than or equal to
 - `>` // Greater than
 - `>=` // Greater than or equal to
 - `==` // Equal to (means only the value is considered during evaluation despite it being a string or integer)
 - `!=` // Not equal to
 - `===` // Strict equals (means value and date type are considered during evaluation)
 - `!==` // Strict not equal

### 'use strict'
 - always make sure to use `'use strict'` (considered a best practice)

 Rules that `'use strict'` imposes and things to note ...
 - **Note** `'use strict'` is ignored by older browsers
 - You will be forced to declare variables first, before their use, and they will be scoped locally where declared
 - You won't be able to use "reserved" key words in JS as variable names (e.g. `eval`, `arguments`)
 - You won't be able to delete variables (e.g. `delete result`)
 - You won't be able to delete functions (e.g. `delete thisIsAFunction`)
 - **If you are not using** '`use strict'` then **you are able to do all of the above**
 - **If you are not using** `'use strict'`then **mis-typed variable names will be globally scoped** (declared globally)

### Truthy, Falsy
 - Any var with a value of a `"non-empty string"`, `10` (integer greater or less than a `0`, but never `0`), or the `true` boolean are considered **`true`**
 - any var with a value of `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`,`false`, or one that contains an empty string `""` evaluates to **`false`**

**Example**
 ```
 function myFunction() {
    let x = "";
    
    if (x) {
        document.write("TRUE");
    } else {
        document.write("FALSE");
    }
 }
 myFunction(); // evaluates to false
 ```

 - rather than use an if statement, you can use the Boolean() function

 **Example**

 ```
 function myFunction() {
    let color = null;
    document.write(Boolean(color));
 }
 myFunction(); // evaluates to false
 ```
